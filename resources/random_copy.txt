Coding and Development: Java developers spend a significant amount of their time writing, testing, and debugging code.
You'll be working on software projects, collaborating with a team, or independently developing applications, web services,
or enterprise systems using Java and associated technologies. This involves designing software architecture,
implementing business logic, integrating with databases, and ensuring code quality and performance.
